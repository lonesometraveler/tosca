//! `tosca-os` is  a library for building firmware for `tosca` devices running
//! on operating systems.
//!
//! This crate targets firmware that requires more resources in terms of
//! computing time, memory capacity, and interaction with external components
//! than typical embedded devices.
//!
//! Currently, only devices targeting `x86_64` and `ARM` architectures
//! are supported and covered by automated tests.
//!
//! Device firmware consists of a description and a set of tasks, both exposed
//! through a client-server architecture in which the firmware operates as the
//! server and its controller as the client.
//!
//! A device description is defined as a sequence of fields, such as the
//! device name, the device kind, and other data used to establish a
//! connection with the related controller.
//!
//! When a controller makes a request to the firmware through a specified device
//! route, the firmware executes the corresponding task and sends a response
//! back to the controller. Routes may also accept parameters to configure
//! tasks.
//!
//! Each route may have zero or more associated hazards, indicating potential
//! risks for the task. Even when no hazards are declared, a route may still
//! pose unknown risks to the device.
//! In such cases, the controller must decide whether to allow or block the
//! request based on its privacy policy rules.
//!
//! This crate **cannot** determine the outcome of device tasks at compile
//! time, as they depend heavily on the runtime environment. Consequently,
//! hazards are purely informational and help the controller decide whether to
//! allow or block requests in accordance with privacy policies.
//!
//! An `std` environment is required to obtain full crate functionality.
